      Welcome to the Library of Book Reviews
    </div>
    <h4>
      Looking for a new book to read? <br>
      Take a "Scroll" through the library! <br>
      Click on the buttons to hear a brief review. <br>
      The library has some unusual characters, too! The library scrolls horizontally, so you move left to right. <br>
      If you find a book you like, there's links at the bottom of the page. <br>
      But be careful! Don't move too fast or you might upset the librarian! <br>
      The faster the move, the less the librarian will let you see. <br>
      Click the doors to enter!
